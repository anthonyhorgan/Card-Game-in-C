# Card-Game-in-C
Simulates drawing from a deck of cards to a hand and performing operations on these hands.
The program has four functions that deals a hand of five cards, prints the name of a card, compares two cards to see which one wins and count how many hands would need to be dealt before that hand contains four aces.
